I am currently a 2nd year Graduate Student at [Computer Science]() department, [University of Alabama in Huntsville(UAH)]().
My interests are in the core areas of Data Science and Deep Learning. I work with [Dr. Vineetha Menon](https://www.uah.edu/science/departments/computer-science/faculty-staff/vineetha-menon), in the field of Big Data Analytics, Data Mining and Machine Learning.
I was awarded a Graduate Teaching Assistantship to pursue my degree and help undergraduate students with their course work focused
on Programming concepts, Algorithms and Operating Systems.

I had completed my undergraduate studies from Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering ([EE](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/EEE/Home)),
[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), in 2015. I worked under the guidance of [Dr. BVVSN Prabhakar Rao](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/bvvsnprabhakarrao/Profile) on EEG Signal Processing for my undergraduate thesis.
