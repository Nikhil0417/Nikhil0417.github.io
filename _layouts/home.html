I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science Graduate Student at
The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). My interests are in the core areas
of Data Science and Deep Learning. I was awarded a Graduate Teaching Assistantship
to pursue my degree and help undergraduate students with their course work focused
on Programming and Operating Systems.
